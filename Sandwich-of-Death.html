        <h3>The Death Sandwich is the flagship product of Death Kwon Do Pizza and Subs and appears in the episode Sandwich of Death. The recipe was created in an ancient dojo thousands of years ago, and was a closely guarded secret. Eventually, Sensai took the recipe and made it into a commercial product, and thus his master holds a grudge. </h3>
