        <h3>"Bacon Pancakes" is a song written by Rebecca Sugar, produced by composer Tim Kiefer, and sung by Jake in the episodes "Burning Low" and "Is That You?." He first sings it while making breakfast, which is bacon and pancakes combined. In the episode from the Stakes mini-series, "Checkmate," Finn sings a variation of this song. </h3>
